# EtoDesigner

Winforms/Glade style designer for Eto.Forms.

Source : [Github](https://github.com/dsoronda/EtoDesigner)

## Why

- For a long time we are lacking proper standalone Eto Designer that could be used in other platforms (Linux & Mac).
- I (author) started to develop in C# back in days of .NET 1.1 using WindowsForms and IMHO it's still easier to develop applications with it vs alternatives.
- Why not ?

## Why LGPL Licence

First, LGPL is not restrictive (viral) as LGP.

IMHO: if you take something from community at least give something back.

SO LGPL simiplified.

In future text, CODE means EtoDesigner application and other EtoDesigner libraries in this project.

You can:

- use CODE freely and your code doesn't have to be become GPL-ed

You should:

- any changes you do in CODE must be under LGPL licence.
